   The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and
I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so
are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only
large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling
stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers,
I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.

   Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and
approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know,
but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping
few who doubt the tendency of such books as Jane Eyre: in whose eyes
whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest
against bigotry- that parent of crime- an insult to piety, that regent
of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious
distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.
